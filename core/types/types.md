# Data Types in Python

Python has several built-in data types that are an important part of the language. Here are some of the main data types:

## Numeric Types

- **int** - Integer values like 1, 2, 3 etc.
- **float** - Floating point numbers with decimal points like 1.5, 2.25 etc.
- **complex** - Complex numbers with real and imaginary parts like 1+2j.

## Sequence Types

- **str** - Strings of Unicode characters like "hello".
- **list** - Ordered sequence of objects like [1, 2, 3].
- **tuple** - Immutable ordered sequence of objects like (1, 2, 3).

## Set Types  

- **set** - Unordered collection of unique objects like {1, 2, 3}.
- **frozenset** - Immutable form of set.

## Mapping Type

- **dict** - Collection of key-value pairs like {"name": "John", "age": 30}.

## Boolean Type

- **bool** - Logical value indicating True or False.

## None Type

- **NoneType** - Special object indicating null or absence of a value.

These built-in types provide the basic building blocks for data manipulation and storage in Python. Understanding how to use them effectively is key to writing good Python code.
